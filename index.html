    <h1>Network Requests Practice</h1>

    <h2>What are network requests</h2>
    <p>It is an HTTP request from your computer to a serverside application for information</p>

    <h2>what are the parts of a network request?</h2>
    <p>The parts of a network request are the header and the body</p>

    <h2>What is a JSON and why is it useful?</h2>
    <p>JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation. </p>
    <p>JSON is a format for storing and tranporting data</p>
    <p>The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, but the JSON format is text only. Code for reading
    and generating JSON data can be written in any programming language.</p>


    <h2>Are network requests synchronous or asynchronous?</h2>
    <p>HTTP is a synchronous protocol. The client sends a request and waits for a response from the service. That's independent
    of the client code execution that could be synchronous (thread is blocked) or asynchronous (thread isn't blocked, and
    the response will reach a callback eventually)</p>
